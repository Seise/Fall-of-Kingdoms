# What is Fall of Kingdoms

It is going to be a browser based RTS(Real Time Stragegy) game with a javascript/jQuery front 
end and a PHP backend. It will be non-flash based.

#Why I wrote it

This project was to actually use the PHP and jQuery/javascript knowledge that I already  
accumulated to create a browser-based game with javascript/jQuery as the front end and  
PHP as the backend. I wanted to create something fun while honing my skills at programming.
Many things are moving away from flash to HTML5, CSS3 and other new technologies. I wanted
to make a game that was not reliant on flash.It will also
be a fun browser game I can play with friends and possibly others.

#Why I am proud of it

Though it is not finished, it has helped my skills tremendously in the languages that I am using. 
It has been a place to focus my skills on.
